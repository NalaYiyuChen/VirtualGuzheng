# VirtualGuzheng
I was inspired to make this project through my group's CalHack's project, Sift, which stirred my curiosity in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was also inspired to make this Virtual Guzheng because I have been playing the guzheng for nearly 10 years and had always hoped to create an online guzheng, although I did not know how to proceed with making such a project. 

The guzheng is a Chinese string instrument consisting of 21 strings. It is also known as a Chinese table harp because it closely resembles the western harp in sound and playing technique. My goal was to recreate a guzheng through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Prior to starting this project, I had no experience in any of these languages. Although my final product did not involve JavaScript, I learned and tried to involve JavaScript multiple times when making this project and have learned key components of all three languages. 

My next step is to allow two strings to be plucked at once.
